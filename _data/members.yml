  bio: Miguel Aguilera is a MSCA research fellow at the University of Sussex. MA works at the interface of complex systems, neuroscience and cognition. MA is interested in understanding the emergence of adaptive behaviour, autonomy and agency at different levels of living entities - from biological to mental and social life. Combining nonlinear and dynamical models, statistical physics and dynamical systems theory, the goal is to generate and understand situated and embodied models of agency in neuroscience, artificial life, robotics and collective systems.

  bio: David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Master’s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.

  bio: Dr. Kalidindi’s research interests are broadly centered on designing material internal structure (including composition) for optimal performance in any selected application and identifying hybrid processing routes for its manufacture. To this end, he has employed a harmonious blend of experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches in his research.
